Hi, I'm Aaron.

![family](/media/family.png)

## The Main Stuff
I teach career changes how to code and land their first job as a software engineer. Currently I live in Durham, North Carolina but my original home (and the only palce I'll eat barbecue) is Austin, Texas.

## More Stuff

**I like to start new things.** Until college, I started rawk bands. Now days, I'm in to starting things that help people advanced their tech careers. I've been "self employed" since I quit my last job in 2015 when I moved to Tel Aviv and helped start the first "code school" in Israel. Most recently (2018) I Project Shift with Sean Doherty in Durham, North Carlina.

**I have some hobbies and will probably get more later (kids).** Here's a list of stuff I'm into:
- I like to workout, kind of. Mainly I like the feeling after you work out. These days (with CrossFit closed) I run several times a week, but never more than 3 miles. 
- I'm a big fan of eating (mostly meat) and cook when I can (at home I'm the designated breakfast cook). 
- I'm a huge fan of making fancy cocktails - my margarita is killer. 
- I enjoy biking and have always lived biking distance to work (Austin, Tel Aviv, Durham).
- I'm a coffee snob.

**I nerd out on...** Productivity (since I'm by default a mess), cookies vidoes, music (I used Rawk)
