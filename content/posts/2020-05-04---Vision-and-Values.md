Do you sometimes find yourself feeling anxious or despondent because you have (or had) dreams that you're just not fulfilling? If I'm honest, I do, and I think most people feel the same way.

But oftentimes the things that I think are my "dreams" really are not my dreams at all. Perhaps my values have changed (such as when I had kids) or maybe even I'm trying to achieve something I think someone else thinks I should achieve.

If I was honest about what I really value, I could probably just chill out and stop feeling so guilty about not "achieving more".

For example, I think I want to be successful, I think I want to change the world, but really those are not necessarily the things that matter to me.

In other words, I need to check and make that my "vision" actually lines up with my "values".

"Vision" and "values" seem like loaded words (or cheesy words), but in the Software Engineering Fellowship I run (Project Shift) we take time the first week of the program to reflect on those two things and define them like this:

**Values**: The (often) unchanging things that sculpt what I care about.

**Vision**: The ideal picture of what my future looks like. It makes up my goals and my dreams.

A couple of months ago I was sitting by the fire with a friend talking about entrepreneurship and he said: "Man, you have a wife and 3 kids and I feel like your risk tolerance is way higher than mine and I don't have kids."

To be honest, my pride welled up inside. I want to be thought of as a daring risk-taker, but to be honest, I've realized that due to my values, I will probably not be as great of an entrepreneur as I could be.

That's because the values of a great entrepreneur (winning, success) are too much in conflict with the values of a great husband and father (being physically and emotionally available).

I think now is a great time to reexamine your dreams/vision. How have you changed as a result of COVID-19? Is it exposing what you really care about so that you can leave behind the things that are not worth pursuing?
