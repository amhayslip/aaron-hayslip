If I'm honest, my biggest fear is financial failure. Likely, I'm probably even more afraid of the shame that would come with financial failure.

I'm married with 3 young kids (ages 1, 3 and 5) and the business that I started supports all of us and has for the last few years. If Project Shift went under, there's a chance that we couldn't pay our mortgage and we'd lose our house. We're not rich. I need next month's paycheck.

Though this scenario is quite possible, I'm not sure how realistic it is. I know how to code and could work as a Software Engineer, which would easily support my family. Worst case, I'd guess that I'd be out of a job for 3 months while I search, but in all likelihood, it'd be far shorter than even that. Sure, we'd go into some debt, but nothing that I couldn't get us out of relatively quickly.

With that out of the way, I'm free to move forward and take risks.

Privilege aside, I'd imagine that you're in a similar position. Whatever fear is keeping you from starting something new, whatever the worst-case scenario is, probably won't kill you (unless you're considering taking up base-jumping).

Take some time and think through what you're most afraid of. Let the worst-case scenario play out in your head. Normally we run from these anxiety-producing thoughts. But as this scenario plays out, are you dead? Likely not. You're smart. You can think up a plan to pick up the pieces.

Now that you're free from that, move forward and take risks.
