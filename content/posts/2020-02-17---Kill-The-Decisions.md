Your ability to accomplish large goals depends on your "will power". And ultimately "will power" comes down to your ability to make many small correct decisions each day.

But these decisions are exhausting. Should I eat the cookie, or not? Should I wake up to my alarm, or press "snooze"? Should I watch Netflix or read my book before bed? The more of these decisions we have in the day, the more difficult it is to make the correct decisions.

Recently I decided that I was going to kill the anxiety that I've been dealing with by waking up early each morning to read and journal before my kids wake up. But I encountered problems.

At 5:45am, not only do I risk waking up my family, but there's also a ton I need to do in order to have a nice peaceful time of reading and journaling.

I need to make coffee (because life isn't worth living if I have to wake up without it), to brush my teeth (because the inside of my mouth tastes like a used cigar in the morning), to find a sweat-shirt (because it's cold) and to locate my journal (so I can journal).

There was a time or 2 when I woke up and realized that none of these things were in order only to roll over and go back to sleep, because who wants to sit around in their cold, dark house at 5:45am without coffee and bad breath? Goal not accomplished.

Fast forward a few weeks and I can honestly say that most mornings I start by waking an hour or more before the rest of my family and by the time they get up, I'm a different person (one that people generally want to be around) because I've had my coffee and time to read/journal.

What did I do? I simply killed the decisions.

Each night before bed I grind coffee beans, set out my sweatshirt, toothbrush, and pen/journal. When the alarm goes off, I quietly sneak into the other room, make my coffee and get to it.

How can you remove these kinds of decisions altogether for yourself? Whether it's purging the pantry of sugar or setting aside an hour each day to code, you shouldn't have to exhaust yourself with saying "yes" or "no" so many times. Just plan ahead and change the scenario.
