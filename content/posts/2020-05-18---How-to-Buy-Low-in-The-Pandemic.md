How do investors make money? They buy low and sell high. Whether it's the stock market, real estate, or even starting a business, the principle is the same. It's all about growth.

Before I get into my point, I want to recognize that we're in the midst of an incredibly devastating time. I also want to recognize that as much as my privilege will allow me to see, it's clear that we're not all affected equally. We didn't all start on the same level and we haven't all been knocked down to the same level.

But is there room to grow, **right now**?

There always is, but in particular, I'm thinking of your professional life. It sounds crazy to think about "career growth" in the midst of a pandemic, but that's exactly what I want to talk about.

Back to my analogy, the best stock-market investors will tell you to keep your money in the market for as long as you can, even during a recession. In fact, there is no better time to buy (if you can) than during a recession. That's because "everyone else" is selling, so the demand declines, as do prices.

But how does this work for personal/professional growth?

I think right right now is the best time to:

- **Reskill** - Learn coding, marketing, design. Turning a company off then on again leaves holes that can't be immediately filled. Be ready to fill those holes.
- **Start a blog/vlog/newsletter** - Those will more time on their hands have more time to listen.
- **Test business ideas** - The world has had a rebirth. Will one of your ideas be part of it?
- **Network** - Decision-makers have time on their hands - create the relationships now when things are less "transactional".

What would it mean for you to make the most out of where you're at now so that it pays dividends in 6 months from now?
