The truth is, no one knows what they're doing, in the beginning. Lately, my 5-year-old, Isaiah, walks around the house trying to talk to my wife and me by spelling out the things he's saying.

We'll say, "Isaiah, can you pick up the playroom?" and he'll spell "no" by responding, "N. O." - It's rude, but it is indeed the correct way to spell "no".

Other times he may try and spell out more difficult words, like "look" and he'll say, "L. U. K." - he doesn't know that he's wrong. Still, we're impressed.

But what if we weren't impressed? What if we laughed at him and told him that he's dumb and that he has no business spelling? What if we told him that his brain probably just wasn't wired to spell?

That would be cruel and ridiculous on so many levels. Not only do we love him because we're his parents, but we also realize that he just started learning to spell (and he's 5). So instead, we're impressed and proud.

But don't most of us expect that this is the way people around us will respond when we try something new? Especially with coding. We assume that those who can code always could. We say ridiculous things like, "they have math/science/logic brains".

The truth is, there was a time when they couldn't code, whether they can remember it or not.

But being a beginner at something is not the same thing as not being good at something, though beginners are usually not good.

Coding is hard, but it's a complete myth that some of us were made for it and some of us were not. Some of us will enjoy it and be interested in it, and some of us will not be. Some of us will pick it up faster, and some of us will pick it up slower.

So embrace the reality for yourself that no one knows what they're doing in the beginning. The sooner you start your beginning, the sooner you can move beyond it.
