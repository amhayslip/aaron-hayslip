Have you tried accomplishing anything difficult lately (like learning to code, cleaning out the garage, reading a book, etc)? If so, what made it so difficult? At any point during your "accomplishing" did you become overwhelmed? If you hadn't become so overwhelmed, would it have been as difficult?

The things worth doing are difficult, and difficult things are overwhelming. But what do you do when you become overwhelmed?

As my wife would tell you, I freeze up and shut down when I'm overwhelmed. This used to happen more than it does now (starting a business, by the way, is difficult), but it's still a regular occurrence in my life.

In fact, I think much of what we call "procrastination" is just us becoming overwhelmed with difficult (worth doing) things and freezing up.

So how do we keep from being overwhelmed and thus stop procrastinating so that we can accomplish what we want/need to accomplish? We organize, simplify, and focus.

This is pretty obvious if you think about it. Naturally, your brain is very good at this process of organizing, simplifying, and focusing. When you have an entire plate of food in front of your face, somehow you choose to focus on one bit at a time and before you know it, it's all gone!

Or one thing that's been popular lately (with all the gyms being closed) are those "couch to 5k" plans. Running a 5k today sounds difficult and overwhelming. Running for 5 minutes though sounds doable. Tomorrow I will run for 6 minutes and more the next day. Anxiety, gone.

I do this every Monday morning when I plan my week. Each Monday morning I have a weekly meeting with myself where I try and figure out what the top 3 things I need to get done this week are. If I trust my process, then I don't have to worry again about being overwhelmed with my "to do" list (at least not until next week).

Here's one last example. If you're wanting to learn to code and want to become a Software Engineer, there are literally 1,000 places you could start. But what if a trusted source told you to just start by learning JavaScript and to not worry about anything else until you have (this is where we start all of our students, by the way)? You would be free to stop worrying about whether your spending your time well - you'd spend all of your time learning JavaScript.

Here are the benefits of this kind of focus:
Instead of trying to multi-task, all of your brain and its creativity is being used on that one thing and thus, you do that one thing well.
You're less anxious because there isn't any part of you that is still deciding on _what_ to do next. You're too busy "doing" for that.
You realize that _more time_ doesn't equal _more productivity_. I will take 1 hour of focused work on the things that matter over 5 hours of bouncing from task to task, any day.
You will actually accomplish what you set out to accomplish instead of spinning your wheels. You know those days when you go to work and you know you were there for hours and you feel exhausted, but you also feel completely unaccomplished? That's what it feels like to spin your wheels. Let's kill that.
How could you apply this to whatever difficult thing you're trying to accomplish this week/quarter/month/year? Need help? Let me know. I can't pretend to have much figured out, but it's nice to have a sounding board.
